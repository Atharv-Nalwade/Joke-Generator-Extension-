## Future Work 🚀

Here are some additional suggestions to improve your future work:

1. **Add functionality to share jokes**: Consider adding a feature that allows users to share their favorite jokes with their friends through various social media platforms or messaging apps. 📱💬

2. **Include categories and tags**: To make it easier for users to find jokes that interest them, you could add categories and tags to your jokes. For example, you could have categories such as "animal jokes," "sports jokes," or "knock-knock jokes." Users could then filter jokes by category or search for specific tags. 🏷️🔍

3. **Implement user accounts**: Consider implementing user accounts so that users can keep track of the jokes they've liked or shared, or even upload their own jokes to share with others. 👤🔒

4. **Use machine learning to personalize the joke feed**: In addition to showing jokes based on a user's previously liked jokes, you could use machine learning to personalize the joke feed based on other factors such as the user's location, age, or interests. 🤖🌎👨🏻‍💼🎭

5. **Add a joke rating system**: Consider adding a rating system for users to rate the jokes they've seen. This can help improve the quality of the joke feed and ensure that users are seeing the funniest and most relevant jokes. ⭐

6. **Improve UI/UX**: Consider improving the user interface and experience of your app. This can include adding animations, improving the layout, or adding visual cues to help users navigate the app more easily. 💻🎨👀
